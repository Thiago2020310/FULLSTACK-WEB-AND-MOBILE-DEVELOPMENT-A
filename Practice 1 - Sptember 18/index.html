                <h1>Sauron's Plan for Domination</h1>
                <p>His primary goal is to manipulate the various races of Middle-earth—elves, dwarves, and men—into creating the Rings of Power, which will ultimately allow him to dominate them using the One Ring he plans to forge. Sauron, under the guise of the emissary Annatar, will use his knowledge of crafting to deceive the elves, particularly Celebrimbor, into creating these powerful rings.</br> In the search for Celebrimbor, Sauron forms a complicated relationship with Galadriel. He reveals his true identity to her and offers her a significant proposition: he asks her to join him in ruling Middle-earth. He views Galadriel as a powerful ally who could help him bring order to the world, albeit through domination and control, appealing to her deep desire to defeat evil, framing his plan as a way to bring peace and stability. </p>
